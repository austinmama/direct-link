{: #get-started-with-ibm-cloud-direct-link}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Direct Link on Classic is a suite of four offerings from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} network, with availability in locations around the globe. Each one enables customers to create direct, private connections between their remote network environments and their {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} deployments, without touching the public internet. Most commonly, these offerings are implemented to support private, hybrid, and cross-provider workloads, as well as large or frequent data transfers, and the easing of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} environment administration.
