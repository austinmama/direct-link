## Direct Link ordering process overview

Here is the general process to order a Direct Link service:

 1. Verify your network provider's capabilities to reach the appropriate IBM Cloud PoP.
 2. Use the [IBM Cloud console ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com) to order Direct Link Connect Classic and complete the requested information. You can request assistance from IBM Cloud Sales engineers. When you are ready to create your order, you are prompted to read and agree to the Master Service Agreement.
 3. Contact your Connect provider and negotiate connectivity to your premise or colocation.
 4. Order a virtual circuit through the Connect provider, and reference the case ID of the Direct Link Connect request as your **Request ID** or **Authorization ID**.

The IP assignment on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} networking infrastructure is completed within three business days after the virtual circuit request is complete.

2. Select **Network > Direct Link > Connect** to open a page that shows the existing Direct Link connections, if any.
3. Click **Order Direct Link Connect +** in the upper right of the page. The "Create an IBM Cloud Direct Link Connect Connection" page is displayed.
4. In the order form, complete the following information to configure Direct Link Connect:
   - Enter the Direct Link instance name.

   - Select the link speed required for the connection.
   - Select the routing option required for the connection.
   - Enter a valid ASN number from the range given in the information box for the BGP exchanges.

   As you select or enter these values, you can see an approximate monthly charge in the right panel.
   
6. You must agree to the [Master Service Agreement](https://cloud.ibm.com/classic/account/masterserviceagreement/getagreement){: external} before you can place the IBM Cloud Direct Link order.  

      After you place your order, an IBM Support case number is generated. You can click the case number to view case details.
      
7. You’ll be asked to complete a customer questionnaire, which you can review at [Direct Link Connect questionnaire](/docs/direct-link?topic=direct-link-ibm-cloud-direct-link-connect-questionnaire).

8. After you provision the direct link and complete the questionnaire, see [Configuring Direct Link Classic](/docs/direct-link?topic=direct-link-configure-ibm-cloud-direct-link) to configure your subnet to interact with IBM Cloud.
